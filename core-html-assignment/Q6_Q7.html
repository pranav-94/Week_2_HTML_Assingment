<body style="font-size: x-large;">
   <center><h1>5 HTML tags</h1></center> 
    <div style=" display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <ol >
        <li>
            Body tag
            <p>The < body> HTML element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one < body > element in a document.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Img tag
            <p>The < img> HTML element embeds an image into the document. <br>
                The src attribute is required, and contains the path to the image you want to embed.
                The alt attribute holds a text description of the image, which isn't mandatory but is incredibly useful for accessibility — screen readers read this description out to their users so they know what the image means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.
             </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Anchor tag
            <p>The < a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Table tag
            <p>The < table> HTML element represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            P tag
            <p>The < p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
